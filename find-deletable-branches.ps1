<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Finds Git branches that have been merged into a specified main branch.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script lists all local or remote branches that have already been merged into the main branch
    (e.g., 'master' or 'main'). It displays the branch name, the date it was merged, and the
    merge commit ID.

    The output is sorted by merge date, with the most recent merges appearing first.
    The results are displayed on the screen and also saved to a file named 'deletable_branches_report.txt'.

    This helps identify branches that are safe to delete.

.NOTES
    - Make sure you are running this script from within a Git repository directory.
    - The script excludes the main branch itself and the currently checked-out branch from the list.
